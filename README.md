FISH: FIle SHaring, a Distributed File System

"Truth is out there"

'FISH' is a file sharing system allowing its users to share media files (such as MP3 and images) on the Internet. Since it has been started, it has known a huge success, in such an extent that some universities have been forced to forbid their students to use FISH on their networks.

You may have recently heard or read about FISH since the trial it lost against some music publishing companies have been one of last summer's success story. Have you already wondered how such a system can work?
